The best way to learn to do a thing is by doing it, so I'm taking a course on how to make a game, and 
turning it into something a bit more original.  This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY - if you paid for
this game, you got scammed, sorry :(

If you do enjoy playing this game and you would like to generously contribute to it's continuation, 
feel free to drop a tip or subscribe to my Patreon.
