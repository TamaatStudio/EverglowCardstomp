Ponyfinder-Themed Digital CCG + Match3 genre blend
The "CCG" elements aren't as far along as the "Match3" elements are, It's a work in progress.

The best way to learn to do a thing is by doing it, so I'm taking a course on how to make a game, and 
turning it into something a bit more original.  This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY - if you paid for
this game, you got scammed, sorry :( There is no expected "release date", it'll be done when I'm done 
tinkering with it.  Which might be never?

If you do enjoy playing this game and you would like to generously contribute to it's continuation, 
feel free to drop a tip or subscribe to my Patreon.
